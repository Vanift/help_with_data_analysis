This is data analysis task that was given to my friend who is finishing his master's degree in data analysis. 
I agreed to help him out with this task because it was a possibility to learn something new to me.

The whole code is located in /main.py file. It is used to integrate tables with exchange rates from /data repository.

Also, one of tasks requirements was to take two pairs of rates and find div values of them. Then to add new columns, 
draw graphs with that values and find min or max values of each column by date. 

However, in this code you can choose more than two pairs and also change settings to use it for different data.
